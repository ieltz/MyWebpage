Keep on Barking at night if he can if theres some myterious hapening outside or theres someone roaming outside. He loves to play with me. He also go with me if i'll go jogging or morning walks. He went to the farm with us rain or shine. I can call him as my best buddy for the reason that he will not leave me wherever am I going. He fulfill he's duty even if he is untrained.
